## IMPORTANT

If you use this software please cite the paper [1] in any resulting publication.


## MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS & RUNNING

In order to run the demos, you will have to
1.  Download and install Tensorlab 3.0: https://www.tensorlab.net

Then, just start MATLAB and run one of the demo scripts (e.g. main_synthetic.m, etc).


## NOTES:
1.  Codes for the generalized sylvester equation solver were provided by Alex Townsend, in [this toolbox](https://github.com/ajt60gaibb/freeLYAP).
