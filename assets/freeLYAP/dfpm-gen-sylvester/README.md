# Dynamical Functional Particle Method for the Generalized Sylvester Equation



### About

The MATLAB code in this repository was used to produce the figures and tables in [sect. 4, 1]. The test suite was developed in MATLAB 2020b, and the experiments were run in MATLAB 2021b on a machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U and 32 GiB of RAM.



### Dependencies

The code in this repository requires the MATLAB `randsvdfast` function from the [randsvdfast-matlab](https://github.com/mfasi/randsvdfast-matlab) GitHub repository. This is included as a git submodule for convenience and can be cloned with
```
git submodule init
```
from the command line.



### Running the tests

The experiments can be reproduced by running the MATLAB script `run_tests` which executes the following scripts in the `tests` folder:
* `test_sylv`, which produces the data used in [Figure 1, 1];
* `test_gensylv`, which produces the data used in [Figure 2, 1]; and
* `test_large_gensylv`, which produces the data used in [Table 2, 1].
The actual tests are performed by the functions with the `_case_fun` suffix, also in the `tests` folder, which generate the matrix equations for a given choice of parameters, solve them, and store the output in an array of `struct`s.

The algorithms we consider are implemented by the MATLAB functions in the `algorithms` folder:
* `solve_cgkr`, which solves a generalized Sylvester equation with Hermitian positive definite coefficients using the unpreconditioned conjugate gradient method on the Kronecker form of the equation;
* `solve_gen_dfpm`, which solves a generalized Sylvester equation using the dynamical functional particle method;
* `solve_gen_gbia`, which solves a generalized Sylvester equation using the gradient based iterative algorithm of Ding and Chen [2];
* `solve_gen_kron`, which solves a generalized Sylvester equation using MATLAB backslash operator on the Kronecker form of the matrix equation;
* `solve_sylv_dfpm`, which solves a Sylvester equation using the dynamical functional particle method (this is a stripped-down variant of `solve_gen_dfpm`); and
* `solve_sylv_dfpm_refinement`, which solves a Sylvester equation by using the dynamical functional particle method with the solution of the Bartelsâ€“Stewart algorithm as starting value for the iteration (this method is not reported as it is not competitive on our test test).

The `matrix_generation` folder contains utility functions for generating test matrices with properties of interest.
